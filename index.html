                <p><b>Spring 2021</b><p>
                <p>The Vision Zero movement seeks to re-design roadways to be safe and comfortable for all users. Vision Zero design standards prioritize the safety of all users as opposed to accommodating the greatest volume of motorists. Vision Zero was conceived and signed into law in Sweden in 1997. In 2019, Oslo Norway was the first major city to achieve zero traffic fatalities for vulnerable roadway users. Vulnerable roadway users are primarily pedestrians and bicyclists, but also include wheelchair users and those using micro mobility.</p>
                <p>The Massachusetts Vision Zero Coalition advocates for Vision Zero design standards on Beacon Hill and in the Commonwealthâ€™s 351 municipalities. As part of their advocacy, they track pedestrian and bicyclist fatalities based on media accounts. The fatalities are visualized on their website. The visualization is accomplished using Google My Maps. Current Massachusetts vulnerable user fatalities exceed the number of points allowed by Google My Maps. The Massachusetts Vision Zero Coalition, being a collaborative of non-profits, does not have the inhouse expertise nor the funds to migrate the current visualization to a more robust platform.</p>
